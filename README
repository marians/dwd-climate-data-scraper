The purpose of this package is to scrape (i.e. download) climate/weather data
that is publicly available at

  http://www.dwd.de/ > "Klima + Umwelt" > "Klimadaten" > "Daten online - frei" > 
  "Klimadaten Deutschland" > "Zeitreihen an Stationen" > "Tageswerte"
  
Unfortunately the original data is not available under a persistent URL.

The data is collected daily from a number of weather stations throughout Germany.

The beginning of the data collection of some of the stations dates back to more
than 100 years ago, so the time series allows for a long-term comparison of
values.

When the script is run, a JSON representation of all datasets is stored locally.
However this can be modified easily to fit other purposes.

The output format is as follows:

station_id
	
	Unique identifier of the weather station. The DWD provides a station list,
	again under a non-permanent URL. You can find it near the original source
	described above
	
date
	
	Date string of the data recording in format YYYYMMDD
	
quality_level
	
	An Integer between 0 and 16 describing the quality level of the record. A
	more detailed explanation can be found on the DWD website near the original
	data.
	
temperature_5cm_min
	
	Minimum temperature 0,05 meters above ground level in degrees centigrade

temperature_200cm_min
	
	Minimum temperature 2 meters above ground level in degrees centigrade

temperature_200cm_average

	Average temperature 2 meters above ground level in degrees centigrade

temperature_200cm_max

	Maximum temperature 2 meters above ground level in degrees centigrade
	
relative_humidity

	Average relative humidity in percent

wind_force_average          = FM  = Mittel der Windstaerke (Bft)

	Average wind force in beaufort (Integer)

wind_speed_max

	Maximum wind speed in meters per second

sunshine_duration

	Duration of sunshine in hours

cloud_amount_average

	Amount of clouds in eights
