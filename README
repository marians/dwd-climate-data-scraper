The purpose of this package is to scrape (i.e. download) climate/weather data
that is publicly available at

  http://www.dwd.de/ > "Klima + Umwelt" > "Klimadaten" > "Daten online - frei" > 
  "Klimadaten Deutschland" > "Zeitreihen an Stationen" > "Tageswerte"
  
Unfortunately the original data is not available under a persistent URL.

The data is collected daily from a number of weather stations throughout Germany.

The beginning of the data collection of some of the stations dates back to more
than 100 years ago, so the time series allows for a long-term comparison of
values.

When the script is run, a JSON representation of all datasets is stored locally.
However this can be modified easily to fit other purposes.
